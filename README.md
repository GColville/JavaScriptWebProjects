# JavaScriptWebProjects

The projects that I have added within this repository are those that I have completed under the Udemy course call "JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your portfolio" by ZeroToMastery.

The mini projects teach us a variety of uses for HTML+CSS+JavaScript which are simple, interesting, and extremely useful to keep in mind for future projects.
